# OBSOLETE - Developer Portfolio Website

## Update - Website No Longer In Use
This website is no longer in use. I created this website as my first developer portfolio website, in order to feature the projects I was working on and had recently finished. I have since created a [new developer website](https://www.helloimjoey.com/) which I actively maintain.

## Description
This was my first developer portfolio website that I built using React.

## Live Site URL
This website is obsolete but can be accessed here: [archived-portfolio-steigelman.netlify.app](archived-portfolio-steigelman.netlify.app)
