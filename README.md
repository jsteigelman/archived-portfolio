# OBSOLETE - Developer Portfolio Website

## Update from Feb 2022
This website is no longer in use. I created this website as my first developer portfolio website in 2021, in order to feature the projects I was working on and had recently finished. I have since created a new developer website, which I encourage you to check out here: [www.helloimjoey.com](https://www.helloimjoey.com/)

## Description - Outdated
This is my first developer portfolio website that I built using React. 

## Live Site URL
Although this website is deprecated it can still be viewed at the new domain: [archived-portfolio-steigelman.netlify.app](archived-portfolio-steigelman.netlify.app)
